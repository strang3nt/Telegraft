# Telegraft

Telegraft is a university project whose goal is study the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/):
it is very simple and stripped down distributed and replicated chat application with Raft built in.
Telegraft uses Scala and relies heavily on Akka technologies.

## Architecture

Since it is a distributed application there are many Telegraft nodes, each one is composed with 2 services:
 
 - `telegraft-raft-service` which is the Raft implementation
 - `telegraft-statemachine-service` which is where the actual business logic happens, the state machine receives read 
    and write requests from (respectively) the rest and raft services and queries a database in order to answer accordingly.

The project `telegraft-benchmark-service` is a project based on [Gatling](https://gatling.io/), and its purpose is to 
provide a meaningful benchmark and stress test for the application.
Follows a diagram which shows the interactions between the components of the project at runtime:

## How to improve this project

### Session and authentication

These are arguably the most important missing features. Both **were not even investigated** for 
lack of time.

### Generation of IDs

Currently IDs in the database are generated via Postgresql own sequential integer generation which is "good enough"
in a small POC, it also works because the database itself is only replicated, not sharded. The reason of using
integer autogenerated primary keys is that state should be consistent between all the raft replicas.

Of course this is not good in a real-world scenario, where usually data is sharded and there are many
concurrent writes, many clusters each of them using some kind of consensus protocol. A solution was provided
by Twitter with [Snowflake](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake), the project
is now archived but there are many updated forks.

### Using streams

Both the `telegraft-raft-service` and the `telegraft-statemachine-service` modules could benefit from supporting
[streaming RPCs](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc).
A streaming oriented gRPC service supports back-pressure. This could be useful both for communications between clients
and the raft cluster but also between any raft server and its respective state machine.
